        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Hello, I'm Edward, a software developer based in London. For over twelve years I've been working professionally on full stack web application development based around the Microsoft .NET framework. Embracing new technologies, I'm driven by the desire to learn, and a passion for the subject. I have pixel-perfect attention to detail, and focus on developing very rich and interactive solutions whilst keeping them as lean and lightweight as possible. With a background in art and design, I really enjoy, and excel at front end development, and due to the increasing vastness of web application development as a subject, I'm looking to re-focus my career in this direction.</p>
        <p>I have superb interpersonal and social skills which translate into being able to liaise effectively with technical and non-technical peers, and provide an excellent ability to turn user requirements, and business rules and use cases into successful software solutions.</p>

              <div data-value="4"></div>
              <h3>HTML5</h3>
              <p>I couldn’t call myself a front-end developer without knowing HTML! With almost 20 years experience, I am fully proficient, and pride myself on neat, tidy, and semantic markup.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div data-value="4"></div>
              <h3>CSS3</h3>
              <p>I’ve been using CSS for over 15 years, and more recently due to the increasing number of mobile users have made use of it’s media queries to implement fully responsive interfaces.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <div data-value="2"></div>
              <h3>SASS</h3>
              <p>As a relative newcomer (12 months) to the world of CSS pre-processors, I cannot believe I didn’t jump on board sooner! SASS assisted no end when I was required to develop an interface that would support right-to-left languages as well as left-to-right at the press of a button.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div data-value="3"></div>
              <h3>JavaScript</h3>
              <p>With over 15 years experience, I am extremely capable when it comes to using JavaScript, I use it in every project to provide a rich and full featured user experience. I now write in ES6, and use Babel to transpile to ES5.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <div data-value="3"></div>
              <h3>JQuery</h3>
              <p>This has been in my skillset for 7 years now. Whilst I use it regularly, the differences in DOM implementations between browsers are not what they were a few years ago, and I’ve started to turn back to using pure JavaScript in projects where JQuery doesn’t offer much in the way of advantages.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div data-value="1"></div>
              <h3>React and Redux</h3>
              <p>I’m a few months into learning React and Redux, whilst applying it to my current work project. The need for increasingly scalable architecture and mobile apps drove a need to rewrite an ASP.net MVC frontend in React and Redux linked to a more flexible WebAPI layer.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <div data-value="3"></div>
              <h3>ASP.net MVC C#</h3>
              <p>I've been working with .NET since the beginning, With the more recent use of the likes of Entity Framework and WebAPI, I am extremely capable in most aspects of this server side technology for developing multi-layered/tiered web applications.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div data-value="3"></div>
              <h3>SQL Server</h3>
              <p>Having used SQL Server for over 15 years, it has a place in almost every project I work on. The creation of fully relational and normalised databases, together with the solid writing of queries and stored procedures mean I have this subject well covered.</p>

              <h3>August 2015 - Present</h3>
              <h4>Software Developer at Reveal Media Ltd., Hampton Wick</h4>
              <p>A designer and producer of body worn video cameras for police and security organisations, I joined their team responsible for developing the software for downloading, cataloguing, and editing the footage that is recorded by the cameras. The software, DEMS, was a desktop only application before I joined, but I was enlisted to help develop a new ASP.net MVC C# version that interfaces with the existing WCF services. It was designed with a responsive HTML5/CSS3 front end using JQuery for client side scripting.</p>
              <p>A key element of the project was the requirement for it to work on mobile devices, and with the development of mobile apps penned for the near future, as well as the phasing out of the desktop application, it was subsequently decided to rewrite it as a SAAS system, with a responsive React and Redux front end connected to a new WebAPI layer, which is the current focus of my role.</p>
              <p>I work in an Agile team, utilising TFS and Git for team collaboration and source control.</p>

              <h4>Software Developer at Jaguar Land Rover Ltd., Gaydon</h4>
              <p>Working on a contract basis for Jaguar Land Rover's electrical engineering department, I provided support for their legacy Classic ASP and XHTML systems, as well as the design and development of new SQL Server backed ASP.net MVC C# and HTML5/CSS3 business applications. The suite of applications running under collective acronym DOTS, catalogued and detailed the electronic components used on the vehicles, and tracked the changes made to them throughout their life, allowing for change approval and sign-off by the relevant members of staff. The new applications were designed and developed with highly dynamic visual interfaces for clarity and ease of use, and featured custom made charts and timelines built with an intelligent use of HTML and CSS. The interfaces were also designed to be fully responsive and touch-enabled due to the use of tablet computers throughout the company.</p>

I had total control of the entire application development life cycle, as well as time and budget management.</p>
